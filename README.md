# Machine-Learning-

Each folder contatins code for different machine learning algorithms, as well as training and test data they are based on.

ML2 aims to identify clusters within the data using K-Means clustering and trains separate Ridge regression models for each cluster.

ML3 builds a Convolutional Neural Network to classify skin cancer as harmless or dangerous, ie. binary classification, from low res images. The model uses image augmentation, class balancing, and evaluation metrics to improve performance.

ML4 is a further developement of ML3, able to differentiate between 6 different classes, using the ResNet50 model for feature extraction.
